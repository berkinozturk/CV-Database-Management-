The CV Generator desktop application allows you to store many CVs in the application, write information about the CV owner, and easily collect the information contained in the system about the CV owner you want.

#### Announcements / Notes

- The CV Management Application will be able to work on Windows 10 computers with java installed. It will not require any add-ons to download. It will include a setup
file and a connected database.

- CV Generator is currently in active development so it's not stable on all platforms. It's being developed in Intellij Idea in Windows 10, so that's the best setup to contribute to the project for now.
