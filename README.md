The CV Generator desktop application allows you to store many CVs in the application, write information about the CV owner, and easily collect the information contained in the system about the CV owner you want.

#### Announcements / Notes

- CV Generator is currently compatible to be compiled only with x64 architecture on Windows. If you would like to use it on different architectures & platforms, you need to compile the vendors for your target architecture and platform include them manually.

- CV Generator is currently in active development so it's not stable on all platforms. It's being developed in Visual Studio 2019 in Windows 10 with x64 architecture, so that's the best setup to contribute to the project for now.
